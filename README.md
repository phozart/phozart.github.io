# This repository contains my portfolio as well as a single web-App to show some knowledge that I gained during my MIT xpro course on Javascript.

# The main purpose of the files within this repository is to show my portfolio and how far I've got with the development in Javascript, HTML and CSS skills.

# What is included?

# #### A video introductino of myself where I explain my skills, work experience and a special question. This Youtube video is embedded in the website.

# An app.js is used to display outcome of one of the projects to show javascript functions.

# Several bootstrap cards are displayed on the Projects folder with a short description and link to the project page. On the project page you can run the selected feature and a link to the github repository for the project is available, a description of the project is also available on each individual project page.

# Bootstrap is used throughout the project to display all features. As bootstrap is used, the required grid layout is only made available within the GRID project accessible on the projects page

# Most content is loaded through the portfolio.js file. where all JS functions that are used within the portfolio are programmed.

# Some of the projects have MIT licenses and coding from these exercises was copied into the application.

# Many of the variables like the menu, the project cards or the socials are defined within Arrays in the top section of portfolio.js and called where required. 

# Possible improvements: update content text, add when new projects come in
