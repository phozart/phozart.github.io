This repository contains my portfolio as well as a single web-App to show some knowledge that I gained during my MIT xpro course on Javascript.
The main purpose of the files within this repository is to show my portfolio and how far I've got with the development in Javascript, HTML and CSS skills.
Part of the Javascript course on MIT xpro passing requirements was to create a portfolio website.
The page is using Bootstrap as a base. most of the HTML in the index.html file is added dynamically through the portfolio.js file.
While creating this project I learned about the usage of bootstrap.
I was hesitating to create separate files to include in the main page for the content, but decided to go with Javascript so that everything stays on one main app.
This same approach I applied in one of the projects where I show my basic Javascript knowledge.
This portfolio is unique in the sense that it's dynamic, using bootstrap and with the extensive knowledge gained in the MIT xpro's course it considers all items learned.
